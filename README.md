### 2️⃣ Switch-Controlled LED System using PIC24FJ16GA002
**Overview:**  
- Controls **Red, Green, and White LEDs** based on a switch.  
- **Red LED** is always ON when the switch is ON.  
- **Green LED** blinks every 2 seconds.  
- **White LED** is ON when the switch is OFF.

### 3️⃣ Temperature Monitoring System with LCD Display 🌡️
**Overview:**  
- Uses an **LM35 sensor** with a **PIC18F2620** microcontroller.  
- Displays real-time **temperature readings on an LM016L LCD**.  
- Categorizes temperature:  
  - ❄️ "Cold" (< 15°C)  
  - ✅ "Normal" (15°C - 27°C)  
  - 🔥 "Hot" (27°C - 30°C)  
  - 🚨 "Very Hot" (> 30°C)

### 4️⃣ Infrared-Controlled Motor 🚀
**Overview:**  
- Uses an **IR sensor** to detect objects.  
- **Motor runs** when an object is detected (logical "1").  
- **Motor stops** when no object is detected (logical "0").  
- Uses **external interrupts** for motor control.
